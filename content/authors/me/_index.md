I am a **Senior Technical Lead** at **Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI)** with ~9 years of experience in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I specialize in bridging the gap between academic research and safety-critical automotive deployment.

My work focuses on **Biometrics, In-Cabin Perception, and Physiological Sensing**, ensuring algorithms are not only accurate but robust enough for embedded deployment in millions of vehicles.

### 🚀 Engineering Highlights
* **Mercedes Pay FaceID:** Successfully delivered the Face Identification system currently deployed in production. Owned the end-to-end pipeline from algorithm design to embedded deployment.
* **Safety Certification:** Led occupancy detection systems for MBUX Interior Assistant, achieving **Euro NCAP** compliance and supporting safety-critical use cases.
* **Top-Tier Research:** Published at **CVPR** and **ECCV** (Best Paper Runner-Up recognition).
* **Patents:** Holder of multiple patents in in-cabin intelligence and automotive perception.

### 🛠 Core Technical Projects

**1. Biometric Security & Face Anti-Spoofing**
I lead the development of Face Anti-Spoofing systems to defend against advanced 3D presentation attacks.
* **Tech Stack:** Multi-modal learning (RGB, IR, Depth), Contrastive Learning, ArcFace objectives.
* **Key Challenge:** Handling sophisticated spoof scenarios using synthetic data and multi-crop strategies on mobile-friendly architectures.

**2. Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS)**
I own the monocular depth estimation modules used to track 3D head movements using only IR images.
* **Innovation:** Utilized domain adaptation with synthetic depth data and hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures to ensure robustness across different car lines and sensor variants.

**3. Physiological Sensing (rPPG)**
*Current Focus:* Leading R&D on remote photoplethysmography to predict occupant vital signs for health monitoring. This work combines signal processing with temporal deep learning models to function in dynamic automotive lighting conditions.
