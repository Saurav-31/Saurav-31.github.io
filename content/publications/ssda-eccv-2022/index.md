abstract: |
  We propose a novel method for semi-supervised domain adaptation that leverages feature similarity between 
  unlabeled and labeled samples across domains to pseudo-label unlabeled data. The approach introduces a 
  combination of loss functions including supervised contrastive loss, instance-level similarity loss, and 
  intra-domain consistency loss, which together help bring features of similar classes closer for both domains. 
  We propose to gradually inject and remove pseudo-labels into the labeled target dataset to increase its 
  support set, achieving state-of-the-art performance in SSDA across benchmark datasets.
