  We introduce ViTOL, a novel approach for weakly supervised object localization using Vision Transformers. 
  The method introduces a patch-based Attention Dropout Layer (p-ADL) in vision transformers to discover 
  object regions in images, along with a Gradient Attention Rollout (GAR) mechanism to aggregate information. 
  The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on weakly supervised object localization tasks on ImageNet-1k 
  and CUB datasets.
